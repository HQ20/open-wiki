# TechHQ Onboarding

## Initial Reading
[Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies for Non-Technical People](https://www.techhq.io/6811/blockchain-and-cryptocurrencies-for-non-technical-people)

## Blockchain Theory
[Blockchain Theory](techhq_development/blockchain_theory.md), and with this I mean mostly articles that illustrate one or more concepts about blockchain that will be useful regardless of the solution at hand.

## Blockchain Platforms
[Blockchain Platforms](techhq_development/blockchain_platforms.md) that allow the deployment of blockchain-based applications onto them. Most prominent examples are Bitcoin and Ethereum, and at the time of writing, there are alternatives such as EOS.IO, NEO, Tron and many others. These should be assessed for consensus mechanisms, smart contract possibilities, language maturity, toolset and developer community.

## Blockchain Applications
[Blockchain Applications](techhq_development/blockchain_applications.md) are solutions deployed to or proposed for [Blockchain Platforms](techhq_development/blockchain_platforms.md). At the time of writing 90% of them are related to [Ethereum](techhq_development/ethereum.md), they are described in a whitepaper and/or website, and have a token economy and ICO associated to them.
